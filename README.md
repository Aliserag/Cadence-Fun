## Cadence-By-Example
Welcome to Cadence-By-Example! This repository is designed for learners who want to explore and develop smart contracts on Flow. It contains a collection of sample smart contracts written in Cadence, ranging from basic to advanced examples.

### Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to enhance the learning experience with Cadence. Whether you are new to the language or already have some experience, you'll find valuable resources here to further your understanding and proficiency.

### Contents
Cadence-By-Example is organized into two main folders:

`cadence example`: Here, you'll find various examples that demonstrate how to write code in Cadence and build decentralized applications (dApps) on Flow.

`cadence fun`: This section provides a solid foundation for understanding the Cadence language.

### Get Started
To dive into the examples and experiment with the Cadence code, you can use the Flow Playground (https://play.flow.com/).

Feel free to explore the code, make changes, and have fun learning about Cadence and its applications on Flow!
