## **Lesson 10: function declaration**

A function declaration in cadence looks like the following:

```jsx
//....code

pub fun setNewValue(newVal:UInt64){

}

//....code

```

This is a function named `setNewValue` that takes one parameters: a `newVal`  of type `UInt64`. For now the body of the function is empty. Note that we're specifying the function visibility as public using `pub` keyword.

### Put It to the Test

- Create a public function named `createKnight`
