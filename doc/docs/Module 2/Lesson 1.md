You can skip this part if you are familiar with Cadence and Flow Playground.

Before delving into Module 2, we assume you have a basic understanding of blockchain, smart contracts, transactions, etc. If not, please refer to [this link] for a quick overview.

In this module, we will use the Flow Playground to construct the Knight game. If you are new to Flow, watch this [video link] to grasp the fundamentals of the Flow Developer Playground.

:::note
The Flow Playground should be compatible with any standard web browser, but we recommend using Google Chrome since it has been tested and optimized exclusively for this browser.

Before delving into Cadence basics and understanding how we write smart contracts in Cadence, take a 5-minute overview of what Cadence is.

### What is Cadence?

Cadence is a new programming language for smart contracts on the Flow Blockchain. It introduces features that enhance smart contract programming, ensuring code safety, security, clarity, and approachability.

Key features of Cadence include:

1. Type safety and a robust static type system.
2. Resource-oriented programming, which we'll explore in later lessons, is a method that combines linear types with object capabilities to establish a secure and clear model for digital ownership.
3. Built-in pre-conditions and post-conditions for functions and transactions.
4. Utilisation of capability-based security ensures that only the owner and those with a valid reference to the object have access control over the object.
5. Cadence’s syntax is inspired by popular modern general-purpose programming languages like [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Its use of resource types maps well to that of [Move](https://medium.com/coinmonks/overview-of-move-programming-language-a860ffd8f55d), the programming language being developed by the Diem team.
